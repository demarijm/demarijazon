# This was built in Next JS. A work in progress. 

## Getting Started

You're probably not looking to run this, just how I built it... but just in case 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
